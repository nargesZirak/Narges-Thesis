\chapter{Conclusion}  \label{conc}
\begin{itemize} [leftmargin=.01in]
\item Determining the detailed structural similarities and differences between source code fragments is a complex task
\item It can be applied to solve several source code analysis problems, for example, characterizing logging practices
\item logging is a pervasive practice and has various applications in software development and maintenance
\item However, it is a challenging task for developers to understand how to use logging calls in the source code
\item We have presented an approach to characterize where logging calls happen in the source code by means of structural generalization
\item We have developed a prototype tool that:
\begin{itemize} [leftmargin=.3in]
\item detects potential structural correspondences using anti-unification
\item uses several constraint to remove the correspondences that are not suited to our application
\item determines the best correspondences with the highest similarity
\item constructs the structural generalizations using anti-unification
\item classifies the entities using a measure of similarity
\end{itemize}
\item An experiment is conducted to evaluate our approach and tool
\item Our experiment found that ...
\item An experiment is conducted to characterize logging usage in three software systems
\item In summary, our study makes the following contributions:
\begin{itemize} [leftmargin=.3in]
\item …
\item …

\section{Future Work}  \label{fw}
\item Future extensions could be applied to resolve the pitfalls of this study:
\begin{itemize} [leftmargin=.3in]
\item Data flow analysis techniques: to resolve the problem of inaccurate statement ordering
\item Further analysis: to detect and resolve all the conflicts happen in deciding the best correspondences
\end{itemize}
\item To further validate our findings from the source code analysis:
\begin{itemize} [leftmargin=.3in]
\item a survey can be conducted to ask developers on the factors they consider when they want to decide on where to log
\end{itemize}
\item Characterizing logging usage could be a huge step towards
\begin{itemize} [leftmargin=.3in]
\item improving logging practices by providing some guidelines that might help developers in making decisions about where to
log.
\item developing recommendation support tools:
\begin{itemize} [leftmargin=.3in]
\item to save developers\textquotesingle time and effort
\item to improve the quality of logging practices
\end{itemize}
