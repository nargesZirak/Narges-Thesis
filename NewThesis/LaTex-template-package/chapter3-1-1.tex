\chapter{An Assessment of Jigsaw}\label{jigsaw-assessment}

\RW{Describe here the procedure you used to select the examples, etc., how you tested Jigsaw, and what your findings were. At some point, you complained that Cottrell had not done something right ... do you have any evidence to demonstrate it?  How does this affect your work?  Such points can go in a discussion section towards the end of this chapter if they don't fit otherwise.  Full details of examples can go in an appendix; here, just describe enough so people can get the point.}
