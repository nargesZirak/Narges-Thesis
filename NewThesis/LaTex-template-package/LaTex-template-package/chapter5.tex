\chapter{Discovering logging usage schemas}  \label{discover}

We conducted an empirical study to find the answer of our three research questions. We study three large open-source software systems, \code{JEdit}, \code{Apache tomcat}, and \code{Jboss}, all written in Java programming languages. Table~\ref{au2_tab1} represents the details about these software systems.
These projects are selected due to their popularity in their area of application\footnote{

Second experiment is conducted to address the following research questions:
\begin{itemize} [leftmargin=.3in]
\item \textsc{RQ3: }what structural similarities and differences do logged Java classes have?
\item \textsc{RQ4: }Is it possible to find common patterns in where logging calls do occur?
\end{itemize}
\item To do so, we applied our tool on the source code of three open-source full systems that make use of logging to determine the patterns on a per-system class-granularity basis analysis
\item These systems are different from the system that the test set is selected from
